abstract = {This paper presents a novel and efficient sensor fusion system for tracking multiple moving vehicles over Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and Radar in autonomous vehicles. What is important in the sensor fusion using LiDAR and Radar is how well they utilize the characteristics of each sensor. The proposed fusion system improves the estimating accuracy and maximum perception distance for the target vehicles by utilizing LiDAR which has high distance accuracy and Radar which has wide Field of View (FOV) and observability of relative speed. In addition, multiple hypothesis tracking (MHT) based track management and extended Kalman filtering (EKF) based filtering enable multitarget tracking with less computational complexity than particle filter-based methods. Three measurement models are designed according to the types of measurement assigned to each track, and the tracks were updated optimally according to each model. The proposed fusion system is evaluated through the real vehicle test with RT-range.}

ABSTRACT = {Nonlinear state estimation problem is an important and complex topic, especially for real-time applications with a highly nonlinear environment. This scenario concerns most aerospace applications, including satellite trajectories, whose high standards demand methods with matching performances. A very well-known framework to deal with state estimation is the Kalman Filters algorithms, whose success in engineering applications is mostly due to the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). Despite its popularity, the EKF presents several limitations, such as exhibiting poor convergence, erratic behaviors or even inadequate linearization when applied to highly nonlinear systems. To address those limitations, this paper suggests an improved Extended Kalman Filter (iEKF), where a new Jacobian matrix expansion point is recommended and a Frobenius norm of the cross-covariance matrix is suggested as a correction factor for the a priori estimates. The core idea is to maintain the EKF structure and simplicity but improve its accuracy. In this paper, two case studies are presented to endorse the proposed iEKF. In both case studies, the classic EKF and iEKF are implemented, and the obtained results are compared to show the performance improvement of the state estimation by the iEKF.},

ABSTRACT = {In the marine environment, underwater targets are often affected by interference from other targets and environmental fluctuations, so traditional target tracking methods are difficult to use for tracking underwater targets stably and accurately. Among the traditional methods, the Kalman filtering method is widely used; however, it only has advantages in solving linear problems and it is difficult to use to realize effective tracking problems when the trajectory of the moving target is nonlinear. Aiming to solve this limitation, an LSTM&ndash;Kalman filtering method was proposed, which can efficiently solve the problem of overly large deviations in underwater target tracking. Using this method, we first studied the features of typical underwater targets and, according to these rules, constructed the corresponding target dataset. Second, we built a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to detect the target and determine the tracking value of the moving target. We used a long-term and short-term memory artificial neural network (LSTM-NN) to modify the Kalman filter to predict the azimuth and distance of the target and to update it iteratively. Then, we verified the new method using simulation tests and the measured data from an acoustic sea trial. The results showed that compared to the traditional Kalman filtering method, the relative error of the LSTM&ndash;Kalman filtering method was reduced by 60% in the simulation tests and 72.25% in the sea trial and that the estimation variance was only 4.79. These results indicate that the method that is proposed in this paper achieves good prediction results and a high prediction efficiency for underwater target tracking.},

    abstract = { We present a new approach to detection and tracking of moving objects with a 2D laser scanner for autonomous driving applications. Objects are modelled with a set of rigidly attached sample points along their boundaries whose positions are initialized with and updated by raw laser measurements, thus allowing a non-parametric representation that is capable of representing objects independent of their classes and shapes. Detection and tracking of such object models are handled in a theoretically principled manner as a Bayes filter where the motion states and shape information of all objects are represented as a part of a joint state which includes in addition the pose of the sensor and geometry of the static part of the world. We derive the prediction and observation models for the evolution of the joint state, and describe how the knowledge of the static local background helps in identifying dynamic objects from static ones in a principled and straightforward way. Dealing with raw laser points poses a significant challenge to data association. We propose a hierarchical approach, and present a new variant of the well-known Joint Compatibility Branch and Bound algorithm to respect and take advantage of the constraints of the problem introduced through correlations between observations. Finally, we calibrate the system systematically on real world data containing 7,500 labelled object examples and validate on 6,000 test cases. We demonstrate its performance over an existing industry standard targeted at the same problem domain as well as a classical approach to model-free object tracking. }

abstract = {A Novel estimator called as Hybrid Unscented Kalman Filter(HUKF) is developed in the paper to tackle the issue of passive target tracking in underwater scenarios using bearing-only measurements (captured by a towed array). As the name indicates the algorithm is a hybrid one obtained by combining three existing algorithms namely UKF, Integration technique and Pre-processing mechanism to yield much better performance than any of them individually. The sensor noise reduction in spatial measurements caused by integration technique together with noise reduction in time measurements caused by Pre-processing mechanism in successive time iterations cumulatively contribute to the improvement in performance. Moreover the montecarlo simulations in Matlab(R2009a) provide evidence that, HUKF also display attractive features like Optimal Performance(produce less estimation errors at less computational complexity), Efficient Tracking in critical conditions(long ranges/severe noise) and Non-Divergence even with nasty initialization. Lastly the algorithm can be helpful in promoting TA usage on regular basis despite of the associated maneuvering issues.}

ABSTRACT = {This study presents a new method for correcting the six degrees of freedom motion-induced error in ZephIR 300 floating Doppler Wind-LiDAR-derived data, based on a Robust Adaptive Unscented Kalman Filter. The filter takes advantage of the known floating Doppler Wind-LiDAR (FDWL) dynamics, a velocity–azimuth display algorithm, and a wind model describing the LiDAR-retrieved wind vector without motion influence. The filter estimates the corrected wind vector by adapting itself to different atmospheric and motion scenarios, and by estimating the covariance matrices of related noise processes. The measured turbulence intensity by the FDWL (with and without correction) was compared against a reference fixed LiDAR over a 25-day period at “El Pont del Petroli”, Barcelona. After correction, the apparent motion-induced turbulence was greatly reduced, and the statistical indicators showed overall improvement. Thus, the Mean Difference improved from −1.70% (uncorrected) to 0.36% (corrected), the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) improved from 2.01% to 0.86%, and coefficient of determination improved from 0.85 to 0.93.},

ABSTRACT = {When tracking very long-range targets, wide-band radars capable of measuring targets with high precision at ranges have severe measurement nonlinearities. The existing nonlinear filtering technology, such as the extended Kalman filter and untracked Kalman filter, will have significant consistency problems and loss in tracking accuracy. A novel mid-state Kalman filter is proposed to avoid loss and preserve the filtering consistency. The observed state and its first-order state derivative are selected as the mid-state vector. The update process is transformed into the measurement space to ensure the Gaussian measurement distribution and the linearization of the measurement equation. In order to verify the filter performance in comparison, an iterative formulation of Cram&eacute;r-Rao Low Bound for the nonlinear system is further derived and given in this paper. Simulation results show that the proposed method has excellent performance of high filtering accuracy and fast convergence by comparing the filter state estimation accuracy and consistency.},

ABSTRACT = {With the significant advancement of sensor and communication technology and the reliable application of obstacle detection techniques and algorithms, automated driving is becoming a pivotal technology that can revolutionize the future of transportation and mobility. Sensors are fundamental to the perception of vehicle surroundings in an automated driving system, and the use and performance of multiple integrated sensors can directly determine the safety and feasibility of automated driving vehicles. Sensor calibration is the foundation block of any autonomous system and its constituent sensors and must be performed correctly before sensor fusion and obstacle detection processes may be implemented. This paper evaluates the capabilities and the technical performance of sensors which are commonly employed in autonomous vehicles, primarily focusing on a large selection of vision cameras, LiDAR sensors, and radar sensors and the various conditions in which such sensors may operate in practice. We present an overview of the three primary categories of sensor calibration and review existing open-source calibration packages for multi-sensor calibration and their compatibility with numerous commercial sensors. We also summarize the three main approaches to sensor fusion and review current state-of-the-art multi-sensor fusion techniques and algorithms for object detection in autonomous driving applications. The current paper, therefore, provides an end-to-end review of the hardware and software methods required for sensor fusion object detection. We conclude by highlighting some of the challenges in the sensor fusion field and propose possible future research directions for automated driving systems.},

abstract="The main non-singular alternative to {\$}{\$}3{\backslash}times 3{\$}{\$}proper orthogonal matrices, for representing rotations in {\$}{\$}{\{}{\backslash}mathbb R{\}}^3{\$}{\$}, is quaternions. Thus, it is important to have reliable methods to pass from one representation to the other. While passing from a quaternion to the corresponding rotation matrix is given by Euler-Rodrigues formula, the other way round can be performed in many different ways. Although all of them are algebraically equivalent, their numerical behavior can be quite different. In 1978, Shepperd proposed a method for computing the quaternion corresponding to a rotation matrix which is considered the most reliable method to date. Shepperd's method, thanks to a voting scheme between four possible solutions, always works far from formulation singularities. In this paper, we propose a new method which outperforms Shepperd's method without increasing the computational cost.",

It is commonly used in the context of a regression model, where one observes pairs of variables (X, Y), with X a covariable and Y a response variable. The expectation of the response variable Y given the covariable X is modeled as a function fβ(X) depending on parameters β. We present an explicit expression for the least squares estimator of β in the linear regression model, and also give its covariance matrix. The calculations are illustrated with a numerical example. The F statistic for testing linear hypotheses on β is also given. We conclude with some extensions.}
